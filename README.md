This project involves conducting stress tests to evaluate the performance and stability of a mobile application under high user loads. The goal is to identify potential bottlenecks and ensure the system can handle peak traffic without compromising response time, reliability, or availability. Gatling is used to simulate concurrent user requests and measure key performance metrics such as response times, error rates, and throughput.
